; TODO: consistent machine heating procedure

; home XYZ
; move to center
; heat to some pre-defined values
;;;;; TODO: can we use the rrf filaments feature to decide what temp?
; wait till chamber gets to certain temp, or just wait a constant time (G4 dwell)
; we can maybe use M191 to ensure consistent chamber temp
